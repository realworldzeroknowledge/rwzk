# Real World Zero-Knowledge meetup
The Real World Zero-Knowledge (`rwzk`) meetup explores applications of zero-knowledge technology in real-world environments such as government, finance, network protocols, and hardware devices.

To propose a topic for a meetup, please open an issue in one or more of the following categories:
- **[Showcase] Product**: showcase of a user-facing product, preferably with a usable demo (e.g. [ZKP2P](https://zkp2p.xyz/))
- **[Showcase] Protocol**: showcase of a lower-level protocol that can be integrated into products, preferably with an SDK (e.g. [zkemail](https://prove.email/))
- **[Discussion]**: open-ended discussion on any practical aspect of new or existing use-cases, e.g. security, standards, compliance, efficiency
- **[Study Club]**: led discussion on a construction / design that targets a specific use-case (e.g. [UTT: Decentralized Ecash with Accountable Privacy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/452)); this can be a more theoretical deep-dive, as long as there are clear eventual applications motivating it
